It works fine for me but I do not guarantee that it will work on your system

You can email me but don't think I am unemployed. I am busy with a lot of thinks!

There a a lot of ocx an dll files in this program. Some of them are part of a professional application that will be released in the future that's the reason why you don't get all the code of the dll/ocx's

Lot of people get bugs in previous versions some are fixed some are there Sorry
